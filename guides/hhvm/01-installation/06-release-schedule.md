Since HHVM 4.2, we aim to release a new release weekly, promoting a recent
nightly build. The majority of releases are supported for 6 weeks.

## Long Term Support

Every 24 weeks (roughly twice a year), a release has "long term support" for
roughly 48 weeks - until two more LTS releases have been made. If the release
due at that time is delayed, support is extended.

As of May 2020, the current LTS releases are:

- HHVM 4.32
- HHVM 4.56

The following releases are expected to be LTS releases:

- HHVM 4.80 (release marks end of support for 4.32)
- HHVM 4.104 (release marks the end of support for 4.56)
