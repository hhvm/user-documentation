Since HHVM 4.2, we aim to release a new release weekly, promoting a recent
nightly build. The majority of releases are supported for 6 weeks.

## Long Term Support

Every 24 weeks (roughly twice a year), a release has "long term support" for
roughly 48 weeks - until two more LTS releases have been made. If the release
due at that time is delayed, support is extended.

Here's a table of recent LTS releases as well as *expected* future LTS releases:

| Version |    \*Release Date       |    \*End of Suppport       |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 4.32    | November 19th, 2019     | October 21st, 2020         |
| 4.56    | May 4th, 2020           | April 5th, 2021            |
| 4.80    | October 21st, 2020      | *September 22nd, 2021*     | 
| 4.102!! | March 23rd, 2021        | *March 7th, 2022*          |
| 4.128   | *September 22nd, 2021*  | *August 24th, 2022*        |

\* *Dates in italics signify an **expected** date.*

!! Hhvm 4.102 was promoted to lts status instead of hhvm 4.104. Its expected support duration has been extended by 2 weeks (to a total of 50) to compensate for the "early start". See the [blog post](https://hhvm.com/blog/2021/03/29/extending-hhvm-4.102-support.html) for more information.
