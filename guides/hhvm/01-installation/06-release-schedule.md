Until (and including) 4.1 we aim to release a new stable version of HHVM every 8 weeks on Mondays.
The branch for a particular release is cut on the Monday 14 days prior to that and then
rigorously tested. It might be delayed if there are any issues found during testing or
we are otherwise not confident in the releases. Point releases will be done as needed for major bugs.

Regular releases up to and including 4.1 are supported for 8 weeks.

With 4.2, we will be moving to a weekly release cycle; new releases will be made
every week, from a recent nightly build. These releases will be supported for 6
weeks each.

## Long Term Suppport

We offer "long term support" (LTS) for every 24 weeks - so roughly twice a year. These releases are supported for roughly 48 weeks. If the release due at that time is delayed, support is extended.

After moving to a weekly regular release cycle with 4.2, we plan to continue offering LTS releases on this 24/48 week cycle.

## Supported Releases

| Version | LTS | Release Date | Expected End Of Support |
|---------|-----|--------------|-------------------------|
| [4.0]   | No  | 2019-02-11   | 2019-04-08              |
| [3.30]  | Yes | 2018-12-17   | 2019-11-19              |
| [3.27]  | Yes | 2018-06-18   | 2019-06-03              |

3.27 was released 2 weeks early, so is supported for 50 weeks rather than the
usual 48.
