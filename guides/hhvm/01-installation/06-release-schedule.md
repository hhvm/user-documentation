Since HHVM 4.2, we aim to release a new release weekly, promoting a recent
nightly build. The majority of releases are supported for 6 weeks.

## Long Term Support

Every 24 weeks (roughly twice a year), a release has "long term support" for
roughly 48 weeks - until two more LTS releases have been made. If the release
due at that time is delayed, support is extended.

Here's a table of recent LTS releases as well as *expected* future LTS releases:

| Version |    \*Release Date       |    \*End of Suppport       |

!! Hhvm 4.102 was promoted to lts status instead of hhvm 4.104. Its expected support duration has been extended by 2 weeks (to a total of 50) to compensate for the "early start". See the [blog post](https://hhvm.com/blog/2021/03/29/extending-hhvm-4.102-support.html) for more information.
