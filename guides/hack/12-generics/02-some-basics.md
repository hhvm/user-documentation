Certain types (classes, interfaces, and traits) and their methods can be *parameterized*; that is, their declarations can have one or more
placeholder names&mdash;called *type parameters*---that are associated with types via *type arguments* when a class is instantiated, or a method
is called. A type or method having such placeholder names is called a *generic type* or *generic method*, respectively. Top-level functions
can also be parameterized giving rise to *generic functions*.

Generics allow programmers to write a class or method with the ability to be parameterized to any set of types, all while preserving type safety.

Consider the following example in which `Stack` is a generic class having one type parameter, `T`:

As shown, the type parameter `T` is used in the declaration of the instance property `$stack`, as the parameter type of the instance method
`push`, and as the return type of the instance method `pop`. Note that although `push` and `pop` use the type parameter, they are not themselves
generic methods.

@@ some-basics-examples/Stack.test.php @@

The line commented-out, attempts to call push with a non-`int` argument. This is rejected, because `$stInt` is a stack of `int`.

The *arity* of a generic type or method is the number of type parameters declared for that type or method. As such, class `Stack` has arity 1.

Here is an example of a generic function, `swap`, having one type parameter, `T`:

@@ some-basics-examples/swap.php @@

The function swaps the two arguments passed to it. In the case of the call with two `int` arguments, `int` is inferred as
the type corresponding to the type parameter `T`. In the case of the call with two `string` arguments,
`string` is inferred as the type corresponding to the type parameter `T`.

Type parameters are discussed further in [type
parameters](type-parameters.md).
