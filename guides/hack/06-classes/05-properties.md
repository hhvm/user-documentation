A property is a variable defined inside a class.

```
class IntBox {
  public int $value = 0;
}
```

Instance properties are accessed with `->`. Every instance has a
separate value for an instance property.

```
$b = new IntBox();
$b->value = 42;
```

Note that there is no `$` used when accessing `->value`.

## Initializing Properties

Properties in Hack must be initialized. You can provide a default
value, or assign to them in the constructor.

```
class HasDefaultValue {
  public int $i = 0;
}

class SetInConstructor {
  public int $i;
  public function __construct() {
    $this->i = 0;
  }
}
```

Properties with nullable types do not require initial values. They
default to `null` if not set.

```
class MyExample {
  public mixed $m;
  public ?string $s;
}
```

## Static Properties

A static property is a property that is shared between all instances
of a class.

```
class Example {
  public static int $val = 0;
}
```

Static properties are accessed with `::`.

```
Example::$val;
```

If your property never changes value, you might want to use a class
constant instead.

## The Property Namespace

Properties and methods are in different namespaces. It's possible to
have a method and a property with the same name.

```
class IntBox {
  public int $value = 0;

  public function value(): int {
    return $this->value;
  }
}
```

(Reusing a name like this is usually confusing. We recommend you use
separate names.)

If there are parentheses, Hack knows it's a method call.

```
$b = new IntBox();
$b->value(); // method call
$b->value; // property access
```

If you have a callable value in a property, you will need to be
explicit that you're accessing the property.

```
class FunctionBox {
  public function __construct(public (function(): void) $value) {}
}
```

Use parentheses to access and call the wrapped function.

```
$b = new FunctionBox(() ==> { echo "hello"; });
($b->value)();
```
