## Input and Output

Input and output is an active area of development in Hack; this page describes a proposed standard
API, with a prototype available in [hsl-experimental], known as "HSL IO".

[hsl-experimental]: https://github.com/hhvm/hsl-experimental/

**HSL IO is currently experimental and not recommended for general use.**.

<p class="fbOnly">HSL IO should not yet be used in Facebook www; you want
the Facebook-specific `Filesystem` class instead. Post in the usual groups
if you can't find a suitable alternative for HSL IO.</p>

HSL IO differs from most other language's standard IO libraries in two particularly significant ways:
- provide as much safety as possible through the type system instead of runtime checking. For example,
  files opened read-only are a different type to those opened write-only; read-write files are a supertype
  of both read-only- and write-only- files.
- designed primarily for asynchronous IO; blocking operations are not generally exposed.

Additional design goals include:
- be internally consistent
- reduce end-user boilerplate. For example, automatically retry calls that fail with `EAGAIN`
- make the most obvious way to do things as safe as possible
- /support/ all reasonable behavior even if unsafe
- be convenient for common cases, but not at the cost of consistency or safety

For a more detailed overview, see the documentation for `IO\Handle`; basic operations include:

```hsl-io-basics.hack
namespace Hack\GettingStarted\HSLIO;

use namespace HH\Lib\{File, IO};

<<__EntryPoint>>
async function main_async(): Awaitable<void> {
  // STDIN for CLI, or HTTP POST data
  $_in = IO\request_input();
  // STDOUT for CLI, or HTTP response
  $out = IO\request_output();

  $message = "Hello, world\n";
  await $out->writeAllAsync($message);

  // copy to a temporary file, automatically closed at scope exit
  using ($tf = File\temporary_file()) {
    $f = $tf->getHandle();

    await $f->writeAllAsync($message);

    $f->seek(0);
    $content = await $f->readAsync();
    await $out->writeAllAsync($content);
  }
}
```
