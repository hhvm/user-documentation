# Generic Entities

Generics can be used on many of the entities you are accustomed to in your programming with Hack, including classes, functions, methods, interfaces, type aliases and traits.

## Classes

Consider the following example in which `Stack` is a generic class having one type parameter, `T`:

@@ entities-examples/classes.php.type-errors @@

As shown, the type parameter `T` is used in the declaration of the instance property `$stack`, as the parameter type of the instance method `push`, and as the return type of the instance method `pop`. Note that although `push` and `pop` use the type parameter, they are not themselves generic methods. 

The line `$stInt->push(10.5);`, attempts to call `push` with a non-`int` argument. This is rejected, because `$stInt` is a stack of `int`, and we are trying to push a `float`.

## Functions

Here is an example of a generic function, `maxVal`, having one type parameter, `T`:

@@ entities-examples/functions.php @@

The function returns the larger of the two arguments passed to it. In the case of the call `maxVal(10, 20)`, given that the type of both arguments is `int`, that is inferred as the type corresponding to the type parameter `T`, and an `int` value is returned. In the case of the call `maxVal(15.6, -20.78)`, `T` is inferred as `float`, while in `maxVal('red', 'green')`, `T` is inferred as `string`.

## Methods

Although the `push` and `pop` methods are defined in the generic class type `Stack` in the classes example above, they are not themselves generic. They are already bound to the class type parameter `T`. 

Like a generic function, a generic method has its own type parameters, even if that method does not belong to a generic class. Consider the library type `Pair`:

```
final class Pair<Tv1, Tv2> implements ConstVector<mixed> {
  // …
  public function map<Tu>( (function(Tv): Tu) $callback ): Vector<Tu>
  public function zip<Tu>(Traversable<Tu> $iter): Vector<Pair<mixed, Tu>>
  public function zip<Tu>( Traversable<Tu> $iterable ): Vector<Pair<mixed, Tu>>
}
```
As we can see, methods `map` and `zip` each take a generic parameter, `Tu`, whose type is inferred from an argument passed to each method. This generic parameter means that we can use it in the method's parameter or return type. Note that the generic method has a different type parameter than the class (e.g., `Tv` vs. `Tu`). Had these methods been bound to `Tv`, then we wouldn't need the generic parameter on the method since it would have already been bound to the class' type parameter.

## Interfaces

Like a class, an interface can have type parameters; for example:

@@ entities-examples/interfaces.php @@

```hack
interface MyCollection<T> {
  public function put(T $item): void;
  public function get(): T;
}

class MyList<T> implements MyCollection<T> {
  public function put(T $item): void {  /* ... */ }
  public function get(): T {            /* ... */ }
  // …
}

class MyQueue<T> implements MyCollection<T> {
  public function put(T $item): void {  /* ... */ }
  public function get(): T {            /* ... */ }
  // …
}

function processCollection<T>(MyCollection<T> $p1): void {
  /* can process any object whose class implements MyCollection */
}

processCollection(new MyList(/* … */));
processCollection(new MyQueue(/* … */));
```

Here, we have generic stack and queue classes each of which implements the same generic interface, enabling those classes to store and retrieve elements in a consistent manner. 

# Traits

Like a generic class, a generic trait has a type-parameter list; for example:

```
trait MyTrait<T1, T2> {
  public static function f(T1 $value): void {
  // ...
}
```

## Type Aliases

A type alias can alias any type, including a generic type. For example:

```
newtype Matrix<T> = Vector<Vector<T>>;
type Serialized<T> = string;    // T is not used
```
