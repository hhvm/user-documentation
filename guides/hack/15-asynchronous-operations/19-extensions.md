Async in and of itself is a highly useful construct that can provide possible time-saving through its cooperative multitasking
infrastructure. Async is especially useful with database access and caching, web resource access, and dealing with streams.

## MySQL

The async MySQL extension is similar to the [`mysqli`](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php) extension that comes with HHVM. The async
MySQL extension is primarily used for asynchronously creating connections and querying MySQL databases.

The [full API](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlConnection/) contains all of the classes and methods available for accessing MySQL via async; we
will only cover a few of the more common scenarios here.

The primary class for connecting to a MySQL database is [`AsyncMysqlConnectionPool`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlClient/) and its
primary method is the `async` [`connect`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlClient/connect/).

The primary class for querying a database is [`AsyncMysqlConnection`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlConnection/) with the two main
query methods, [`query`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlConnection/query/) and [`queryf`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlConnection/queryf/),
both of which are `async`. There is also a function to ensure that queries to be executed are safe called
[`escapeString`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlConnection/escapeString/).

The primary class for retrieving results from a query is an abstract class called `AsyncMysqlResult`, which itself has two concrete
subclasses called [`AsyncMysqlQueryResult`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlQueryResult/) and
[`AsyncMysqlErrorResult`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlErrorResult/). The main methods on these classes are
[`vectorRows`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlQueryResult/vectorRows/) and [`mapRows`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlQueryResult/mapRows/), both *non-async*.

Here is a simple example that shows how to get a user name from a database using this extension:

```async-mysql.hack
use \Hack\UserDocumentation\API\Examples\AsyncMysql\ConnectionInfo as CI;

async function get_connection(): Awaitable<\AsyncMysqlConnection> {
  // Get a connection pool with default options
  $pool = new \AsyncMysqlConnectionPool(darray[]);
  // Change credentials to something that works in order to test this code
  return await $pool->connect(
    CI::$host,
    CI::$port,
    CI::$db,
    CI::$user,
    CI::$passwd,
  );
}

async function fetch_user_name(
  \AsyncMysqlConnection $conn,
  int $user_id,
): Awaitable<?string> {
  // Your table and column may differ, of course
  $result = await $conn->queryf(
    'SELECT name from test_table WHERE userID = %d',
    $user_id,
  );
  // There shouldn't be more than one row returned for one user id
  invariant($result->numRows() === 1, 'one row exactly');
  // A vector of vector objects holding the string values of each column
  // in the query
  $vector = $result->vectorRows();
  return $vector[0][0]; // We had one column in our query
}

async function get_user_info(
  \AsyncMysqlConnection $conn,
  string $user,
): Awaitable<Vector<Map<string, ?string>>> {
  $result = await $conn->queryf(
    'SELECT * from test_table WHERE name = %s',
    $conn->escapeString($user),
  );
  // A vector of map objects holding the string values of each column
  // in the query, and the keys being the column names
  $map = $result->mapRows();
  return $map;
}

<<__EntryPoint>>
async function async_mysql_tutorial(): Awaitable<void> {
  $conn = await get_connection();
  if ($conn !== null) {
    $result = await fetch_user_name($conn, 2);
    \var_dump($result);
    $info = await get_user_info($conn, 'Fred Emmott');
    \var_dump($info is vec<_>);
    \var_dump($info[0] is dict<_, _>);
  }
}
```.example.hhvm.out
string(11) "Fred Emmott"
bool(true)
bool(true)
```.hhvm.expectf
string(%d) "%s"
bool(true)
bool(true)
```.skipif
await \Hack\UserDocumentation\API\Examples\AsyncMysql\skipif_async();
```

### Connection Pools

The async MySQL extension does *not* support multiplexing; each concurrent query requires its own connection. However, the extension
does support connection pooling.

The async MySQL extension provides a mechanism to pool connection objects so we don't have to create a new connection every time we
want to make a query. The class is [`AsyncMysqlConnectionPool`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlConnectionPool/) and one can be created like this:

```async-mysql-connection-pool.hack
use \Hack\UserDocumentation\API\Examples\AsyncMysql\ConnectionInfo as CI;

function get_pool(): \AsyncMysqlConnectionPool {
  return new \AsyncMysqlConnectionPool(
    darray['pool_connection_limit' => 100],
  ); // See API for more pool options
}

async function get_connection(): Awaitable<\AsyncMysqlConnection> {
  $pool = get_pool();
  $conn = await $pool->connect(
    CI::$host,
    CI::$port,
    CI::$db,
    CI::$user,
    CI::$passwd,
  );
  return $conn;
}

<<__EntryPoint>>
async function run(): Awaitable<void> {
  $conn = await get_connection();
  \var_dump($conn);
}
```.hhvm.expect
object(AsyncMysqlConnection) (0) {
}
```.skipif
await \Hack\UserDocumentation\API\Examples\AsyncMysql\skipif_async();
```

It is ***highly recommended*** that connection pools are used for MySQL connections; if for some reason we really need one, single asynchronous
client, there is an [`AsyncMysqlClient`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlClient/) class that provides a
[`connect`](../reference/class/AsyncMysqlClient/connect/) method.

## MCRouter

MCRouter is a memcached protocol-routing library. To help with  [memcached](http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) deployment, it
provides features such as connection pooling and prefix-based routing.

The async MCRouter extension is basically an async subset of the Memcached extension that is part of HHVM. The primary class is
[`MCRouter`](../reference/class/MCRouter/). There are two ways to create an instance of an MCRouter object. The
[`createSimple`](../reference/class/MCRouter/createSimple/) method takes a vector of server addresses where memcached is running. The
more configurable [`__construct`](../reference/class/MCRouter/__construct/) method allows for more option tweaking. After getting an object,
we can use the `async` versions of the core memcached protocol methods like [`add`](../reference/class/MCRouter/add/),
[`get`](../reference/class/MCRouter/get/) and [`del`](../reference/class/MCRouter/del/).

Here is a simple example showing how one might get a user name from memcached:

```async-mcrouter.hack
function get_mcrouter_object(): \MCRouter {
  $servers = Vector {\getenv('HHVM_TEST_MCROUTER')};
  $mc = \MCRouter::createSimple($servers);
  return $mc;
}

async function add_user_name(
  \MCRouter $mcr,
  int $id,
  string $value,
): Awaitable<void> {
  $key = 'name:'.$id;
  await $mcr->set($key, $value);
}

async function get_user_name(\MCRouter $mcr, int $user_id): Awaitable<string> {
  $key = 'name:'.$user_id;
  try {
    $res = await \HH\Asio\wrap($mcr->get($key));
    if ($res->isSucceeded()) {
      return $res->getResult();
    }
    return "";
  } catch (\MCRouterException $ex) {
    echo $ex->getKey().\PHP_EOL.$ex->getOp();
    return "";
  }
}

<<__EntryPoint>>
async function run(): Awaitable<void> {
  $mcr = get_mcrouter_object();
  await add_user_name($mcr, 1, 'Joel');
  $name = await get_user_name($mcr, 1);
  \var_dump($name); // Should print "Joel"
}
```.example.hhvm.out
string(4) "Joel"
```.hhvm.expectf
string(%d) "%s"
```.skipif
\Hack\UserDocumentation\API\Examples\MCRouter\skipif();
```

If an issue occurs when using this protocol, two possible exceptions can be thrown: `MCRouterException` when something goes wrong with
a core option, like deleting a key; `MCRouterOptionException` when the provide option list can't be parsed.

## cURL

Hack currently provides two async functions for [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/).

### `curl_multi_await`

cURL provides a data transfer library for URLs. The async cURL extension provides two functions, one of which is a wrapper around the
other. `curl_multi_await` is the async version of HHVM's `curl_multi_select`. It waits until there is activity on the cURL handle and
when it completes, we use `curl_multi_exec` to process the result, just as we would in the non-async situation.

```Hack
async function curl_multi_await(resource $mh, float $timeout = 1.0): Awaitable<int>;
```

### `curl_exec`

The function `HH\Asio\curl_exec` is a wrapper around `curl_multi_await`. It is easy to use as we don't necessarily have to worry about
resource creation since we can just pass a string URL to it.

```Hack
namespace HH\Asio {
  async function curl_exec(mixed $urlOrHandle): Awaitable<string>;
}
```

Here is an example of getting a vector of URL contents, using a lambda expression to cut down on the code verbosity that would come with
full closure syntax:

```async-curl.hack
function get_urls(): vec<string> {
  return vec[
    "http://example.com",
    "http://example.net",
    "http://example.org",
  ];
}

async function get_combined_contents(
  vec<string> $urls,
): Awaitable<vec<string>> {
  // Use lambda shorthand syntax here instead of full closure syntax
  $handles = \HH\Lib\Vec\map_with_key(
    $urls,
    ($idx, $url) ==> \HH\Asio\curl_exec($url),
  );
  $contents = await \HH\Lib\Vec\from_async($handles);
  echo \HH\Lib\C\count($contents)."\n";
  return $contents;
}

<<__EntryPoint>>
function main(): void {
  \HH\Asio\join(get_combined_contents(get_urls()));
}
```

## Streams

The async stream extension has one function, [`stream_await`](../reference/function/stream_await/), which is functionally similar
to HHVM's [`stream_select`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-select.php). It waits for a stream to enter a state (e.g.,
`STREAM_AWAIT_READY`), but without the multiplexing functionality of [`stream_select`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-select.php). We
can use [HH\Lib\Vec\from_async](../reference/function/HH.Lib.Vec.from_async/) to await multiple stream handles, but the resulting combined awaitable won't be complete
until all of the underlying streams have completed.

```Hack
async function stream_await(resource $fp, int $events, float $timeout = 0.0): Awaitable<int>;
```

The following example shows how to use [`stream_await`](../reference/function/stream_await/) to write to resources:

```async-stream.hack
function get_resources(): vec<resource> {
  $r1 = \fopen('php://stdout', 'w');
  $r2 = \fopen('php://stdout', 'w');
  $r3 = \fopen('php://stdout', 'w');

  return vec[$r1, $r2, $r3];
}

async function write_all(vec<resource> $resources): Awaitable<void> {
  $write_single_resource = async function(resource $r) {
    $status = await \stream_await($r, \STREAM_AWAIT_WRITE, 1.0);
    if ($status === \STREAM_AWAIT_READY) {
      \fwrite($r, \str_shuffle('ABCDEF').\PHP_EOL);
    }
  };
  // You will get 3 shuffled strings, each on a separate line.
  await Vec\from_async(\array_map($write_single_resource, $resources));
}

<<__EntryPoint>>
function main(): void {
  \HH\Asio\join(write_all(get_resources()));
}
```.hhvm.expectf
%s
%s
%s
```
