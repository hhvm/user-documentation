At runtime, the `as` operator evaluates to the left-hand operand if that operand's type matches the type named by the right-hand operand; otherwise, the operator throws 
a `TypeAssertionException`. Statically, the operator unconditionally [refines](../types/type-refinement.md) the type of the left-hand operand. The `as` operator 
also comes in a non-throwing variant `?as`, which evaluates to `null` if the types don’t match. For example:

```Hack
1 as int        // 1
'foo' as int    // TypeAssertionException
1 as num        // 1
1.5 as num      // 1.5
'foo' as num    // TypeAssertionException
```

For enums, the operator validates that the value is in the given enum.

```Hack
enum MyEnum: int {
  FOO = 1;
}
1 as MyEnum       // 1
42 as MyEnum      // TypeAssertionException
'foo' as MyEnum   // TypeAssertionException
```

For generic types, we must use the _ (wildcard) placeholder for the type parameters.

```Hack
interface MyInterface<T> {}
$x as dict<_, _>;
```

For tuples and shapes, the operator validates the size and recursively validates every field in the value.

```Hack
$x as shape(
  'foo' => int,
  ?'bar' => (int, ?string, MyEnum),
  // ...
);
```

For type aliases and type constants, the operators will test the value against the underlying runtime type.

The `nonnull` type is handled specially; if the left-hand operand of `as nonnull` is known to be of type `?T`, it is refined to `T`, instead of simply to `nonnull`.
