# Type Casting

In Hack, variables can be cast to different types as normal, following the various set of [pre-defined rules](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php#language.types.typecasting) for casting.

**NOTE**: There is one modification to the rules. Remember, you cannot use the [aliases for certain primitives](type-system#Alias Primitives) in Hack (e.g, `boolean` instead of `bool`).
