### Hack's Features

Hack introduces many new features to the base PHP language, however there are some features we think are the real standouts:

* [Type System and the Typechecker](../overview/typing.md)
* [Async Programming](../overview/async.md)
* [Collections, Shapes, and Enums](../overview/collections.md)


If you're new to Hack, or even to PHP, please read through these feature overviews before you [get started](../getting-started/getting-started.md) with learning the language.
