The core primitive types are not always the best type for a variable or property. Yes, `bool` allows us to store answers to Yes/No questions,
and `?bool` allows us to store an extra value, (don't know/not available), but what is the best way to represent something like a variable
that has more than three, but less than say 10 states? For example, when working with some sort of windowing system, we might want placement-direction
values like Top, Bottom, Left, Right, and Center.  And while we could use `int`, that type allows far more invalid values than there are valid ones.
The solution is to use an enumerated type and its associated values. For example:

As multiple enumerated types can have enumeration constants of the same name, when referring to an enumeration constant, we must qualify it with
its parent enumerated type name, as in `Position::Top`.

An enumeration consists of a set of zero or more named, constant values called *enumeration constants* having type `int` or `string`.
Each distinct enumeration constitutes a different enumerated type. An instance of an enumerated type is called an *enum*. Each enumerated
type has a corresponding underlying type, which is limited to `int` or `string`.  As we can see above, the type `enum Position` has an underlying
type of `int`, and a set of five constant values `Top`, `Bottom`, `Left`, `Right`, and `Center`, with the corresponding values 0-4. (The choice
of values is up to the programmer.) And while enumerated constant within any given enumerated type must be distinct, multiple constants *can*
be given the *same* value. For example:

The initializer for an enumeration can contain non-trivial constant expressions including references to the names of other enumeration-constants
in the same enumerated type.  For example:

Here, the underlying type has a *type constraint* (via an `as` clause). In the absence of the constraint, the type of `F1`, `F2`, and `F3`
is `enum BitFlags`, which is not an integer type.  So, it can't be involved in bit-shifting. However, with the constraint, their type is
that of the constraint, in this case, `int`.  This allows these enumeration constants to be used in the context of an `int` (such as with
the relational or bitwise operators), but not vice versa.

Here's an example that uses enumeration constants with `string` values:

All enumerated types behave as if they contain a set of public static methods.

Here is an example that uses several of these methods:
