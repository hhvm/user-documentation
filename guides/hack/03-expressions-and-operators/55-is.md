Operator `is` determines if the value designated by its left-hand operand has the type specified by the right-hand one.  The operator returns a `bool` result.  The
operator [refines](../types/type-refinement.md) the type of its left-hand operand when used in an `if` statement, `invariant`, or ternary expression.

Operator `is` should be used instead of calls to library functions like `is_bool`, `is_int`, and so on.

For example:

```Hack
1 is int        // true
'foo' is int    // false
1 is num        // true
1.5 is num      // true
'foo' is num    // false
```

For enums, the operator validates that the value is in the given enum.

```Hack
enum MyEnum: int {
  FOO = 1;
}
1 is MyEnum       // true
42 is MyEnum      // false
'foo' is MyEnum   // false
```

For generic types, we must use the _ (wildcard) placeholder for the type parameters.

```Hack
interface MyInterface<T> {}
$x is MyInterface<_>;
```

For tuples and shapes, operator `is` validates the size and recursively validates every field in the value.

```Hack
$x is (int, ?string, bool)
```

For type aliases and type constants, the operator tests the value against the underlying runtime type.

The `nonnull` type is handled specially; if the left-hand operand of `is nonnull` is known to be of type `?T`, it is refined to `T`, instead of simply to `nonnull`.
