# Reading and Writing Hack Collections

Like arrays, you use the square bracket syntax (`[]`) to read and write from Hack collections. 

## Reading

There are a few ways to read from a collection. You can use `[]`, call methods like `contains()` and `containsKey()` or use functions like `isset()` and `empty()`.

### Square bracket Syntax  `[]`

You can use square bracket syntax to read from collections.

```
echo $coll[key];
```

`Set`s do not have keys, so it is a bit strange to use the square bracket syntax for reading, although you can do it at runtime. The Hack typechecker will throw an error, however. You basically replace `key` above with the value in the set you are looking for. Since it is confusing, it is just better to use `contains()` instead.

If you use square brackets to read from a collection and the key does not exist in the collection (or the value in the case of a `Set`), then an `OutOfBoundsException` is thrown.

### Containing Functions

To test whether a key exists in a `Vector`, `Map` or `Pair`, you can also use the `containsKey()` method. Using `containsKey()` as opposed to `[]` allows you to avoid the possibility of an `OutOfBoundsException` being thrown.

For a `Set`, use `contains()` to check if a value exists in the set.

**Note**: Using `contains()` on a `Vector`, `Map` or `Pair` is synonymous with `containsKey()`.

You can also use [`isset()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php) or [`empty()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php) for key (or value for sets) testing as well. Just note that these functions are not supported in [Hack's strict mode](../typechecker/modes.md)

**Note**: You can use other array functions like [`array_key_exists()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-key-exists.php), [`array_keys()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-keys.php) with Hack collections as well.

## Writing

### Square Bracket Syntax `[]`

You can append values to `Vector`s and `Set`s using an empty `[]`. 

For `Map`s you have two ways to append a value using `[]`. 

You cannot append a value to a `Pair`. An `InvalidOperationException` will be thrown and the Hack typechecker will throw an error.

```
$map[newKey] = value;
$map[] = Pair {key, value};
```

### Appending Methods

You can also use `add()` to pass a value to be added to a `Vector` or `Set`. And for `Map`s, you can use `add()`, but pass `Pair` with a key and value.

### Deleting Methods

To remove a value from a `Vector`, use `removeKey`(), passing in the index `n` to remove. This will remove that index, the value associated with that index, and finally shift down one all indices `n + 1` to the final index.

To remove a value from a `Map`, you also use `removeKey()`, passing in the key to remove.

To remove a value from a `Set`, use `remove()`, passing in the value in the set to remove.

You cannot remove from a `Pair`.

**Note**: You can use [`unset()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php) on `Map` and `Set`, but not on `Vector`. `Vector`s shift the indices after a removal, but arrays do not, and `unset()` was originally meant for arrays.
