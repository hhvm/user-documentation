Store a value (replacing if present)







``` Hack
public function set(
  string $key,
  string $value,
  int $flags = 0,
  int $expiration = 0,
): Awaitable<void>;
```




## Parameters




+ ` string $key ` - Name of the key to store
+ ` string $value ` - Datum to store
+ ` int $flags = 0 `
+ ` int $expiration = 0 `




## Returns




* ` Awaitable<void> `




## Examples




The following example shows how to use ` MCRouter::set ` to set key/value pair to the memcached server. While you cannot `` MCRouter::add `` the same key twice, you can reset a value for a given key via ``` set ```. It is quite possible to always use ```` set ```` instead of ````` add ````` since it is generally superset of functionality, but `````` add `````` can be good if you explicitly want to catch someone trying to set a key to a different value.




If you pass an expiration time for the key, that is in seconds.




And these are the bitwise or style flags that can be passed to ` set `:




```
MC_MSG_FLAG_PHP_SERIALIZED = 0x1,
MC_MSG_FLAG_COMPRESSED = 0x2,
MC_MSG_FLAG_FB_SERIALIZED = 0x4,
MC_MSG_FLAG_FB_COMPACT_SERIALIZED = 0x8,
MC_MSG_FLAG_ASCII_INT_SERIALIZED = 0x10,
MC_MSG_FLAG_NZLIB_COMPRESSED = 0x800,
MC_MSG_FLAG_QUICKLZ_COMPRESSED = 0x2000,
MC_MSG_FLAG_SNAPPY_COMPRESSED = 0x4000,
MC_MSG_FLAG_BIG_VALUE = 0X8000,
MC_MSG_FLAG_NEGATIVE_CACHE = 0x10000,
MC_MSG_FLAG_HOT_KEY = 0x20000,
```




See the [header file with the flags](<https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter/blob/5f259ed47b52f86cad750d2343edf324e80cb397/mcrouter/lib/mc/msg.h>)
