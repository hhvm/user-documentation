A Hack program is made up of a well-formed series of source *tokens* 
(such as user-defined names, keywords, operators, punctuators, and literals). 
To avoid ambiguity or to make source code more readable, in a source file, 
white space characters can be placed before the first token, after the last token, 
and between any two adjacent tokens.
